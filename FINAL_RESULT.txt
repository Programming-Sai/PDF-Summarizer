We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the overall computer system
A computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs, and the users (Figure 1.1). The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the system
The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets, compilers, and Web browsers—deﬁne the ways in which these resources are used to solve users’ computing problems
The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users. We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software, and data
The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system
An operating system is similar to a government
Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself



####### 1.1.1 User View ##############



It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system.  The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used
Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit
Such a system is designed for one user
