####### 1.1 What Operating Systems Do ##############


 We begin our discussion by looking at the operating system’s role in the overall computer system
A computer system can be divided roughly into four components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs, and the users (Figure 1.1). The hardware—the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the system
The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets, compilers, and Web browsers—deﬁne the ways in which these resources are used to solve users’ computing problems
The operating system controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users. We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software, and data
The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in the operation of the computer system
An operating system is similar to a government
Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself
It simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work. To understand more fully the operating system’s role, we next explore operating systems from two viewpoints: that of the user and that of the system. 


####### 1.1.1 User View ##############


 The user’s view of the computer varies according to the interface being used
Most computer users sit in front of a PC, consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit
Such a system is designed for one user

 5 to monopolize its resources
The goal is to maximize the work (or play) that the user is performing
In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for ease of use, with some attention paid to performance and none paid to resource utilization—how various hardware and software resources are shared
Performance is, of course, important to the user; but such systems are optimized for the single-user experience rather than the requirements of multiple users. In other cases, a user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer
The operating system in such cases is designed to maximize resource utilization— to assure that all available CPU time, memory, and I/O are used efﬁciently and that no individual user takes more than her fair share. In still other cases, users sit at workstations connected to networks of other workstations and servers
These users have dedicated resources at their disposal, but they also share resources such as networking and servers, including ﬁle, compute, and print servers
Therefore, their operating system is designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization. Recently, many varieties of mobile computers, such as smartphones and tablets, have come into fashion
Increasingly, these mobile devices are replacing desktop and laptop computers for people who are primarily interested in using computers for e-mail and web browsing
The user interface for mobile computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping ﬁngers across the screen rather than using a physical keyboard and mouse. Some computers have little or no user view
For example, embedded computers in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads and may turn indicator lights on or off to show status, but they and their operating systems are designed primarily to run without user intervention. 


####### 1.1.2 System View ##############


 From the computer’s point of view, the operating system is the program most intimately involved with the hardware
In this context, we can view an operating system as a resource allocator
A computer system has many resources that may be required to solve a problem: CPU time, memory space, ﬁle-storage space, I/O devices, and so on
The operating system acts as the manager of these resources
Facing numerous and possibly conﬂicting requests for resources, the operating system must decide how to allocate them to speciﬁc programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efﬁciently and fairly
As we have seen, resource allocation is especially important where many users access the same mainframe or minicomputer. A slightly different view of an operating system emphasizes the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs
A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

Computers are present within toasters, cars, ships, spacecraft, homes, and businesses
They are the basis for game machines, music players, cable TV tuners, and industrial control systems
Computing started as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly moved to ﬁxed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and trajectory plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation
In the 1960s, Moore’s Law predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every eighteen months, and that prediction has held true
Computers gained in functionality and shrunk in size, leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and variety of operating systems
(See Chapter 20 for more details on the history of operating systems.) How, then, can we deﬁne what an operating system is? In general, we have no completely adequate deﬁnition of an operating system
These programs require certain common operations, such as those controlling the I/O devices. The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are then brought together into one piece of software: the operating system. In addition, we have no universally accepted deﬁnition of what is part of the operating system
Some systems take up less than a megabyte of space and lack even a full-screen editor, whereas others require gigabytes of space and are based entirely on graphical windowing systems
A more common deﬁnition, and the one that we usually follow, is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer—usually called the kernel
(Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs: system programs, which are associated with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernel, and application programs, which include all programs not associated with the operation of the system.) The matter of what constitutes an operating system became increasingly important as personal computers became more widespread and operating systems grew increasingly sophisticated
In 1998, the United States Department of Justice ﬁled suit against Microsoft, in essence claiming that Microsoft included too much functionality in its operating systems and thus prevented application vendors from competing
(For example, a Web browser was an integral part of the operating systems.) As a result, Microsoft was found guilty of using its operating-system monopoly to limit competition. Today, however, if we look at operating systems for mobile devices, we see that once again the number of features constituting the operating system

 7 is increasing
Mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernel but also middleware—a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers
For example, each of the two most promi- nent mobile operating systems—Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android—features a core kernel along with middleware that supports databases, multimedia, and graphics (to name a only few). 


####### 1.2 Computer-System Organization ##############


 Before we can explore the details of how computer systems operate, we need general knowledge of the structure of a computer system
The section is mostly concerned with computer-system organization, so you can skim or skip it if you already understand the concepts. 


####### 1.2.1 Computer-System Operation ##############


 A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory (Figure 1.2)
To ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes access to the memory. For a computer to start running—for instance, when it is powered up or rebooted—it needs to have an initial program to run
Typically, it is stored within the computer hardware in read-only memory (ROM) or electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), known by the general term ﬁrmware
